# TIPS

* Always read the instructions properly. Most problem you've encountered when doing assignment was likely because you've made some mistake and one of the first way to prevent that was just read the instruction with care
* Try to understand what you have done. When doing assignment, you're most likely just copy paste the code or something to your terminal or just follow the screenshot. But try to understand what the code is, what it's actually do, what something in the screenshot picture actually means so at least you have some idea what you have done
* Always prepare some OVA backup. Many people consider backup as something that was not really important to do. That was not actually wrong, but only if you believe that you won't make any mistake or problem. Some problem will immediately appear but some will not and will only appear when you doing the future assignment. If you want, you can backup every week, but i really suggest you to make backup before doing Week 03 assignment when you make some virtual disk and of course, when doing LFS
* Follow the course's rule. No push in the boots, do the assignment as soon as possible so when you encounter some problem at least you still have some time and not rushing hours.
* Don't waste this once in a lifetime opportunity. This course is your golden chance to increase your GPA so i mean it, don't waste it.
